# Automated Quantification of Photoreceptor Alteration in Macular Disease using Optical Coherence Tomography and Deep Learning

This code corresponds to the implementation of the U-shaped deep neural networks that we used in our Scientific Reports paper, entitled
"Automated Quantification of Photoreceptor Alteration in Macular Disease using Optical Coherence Tomography and Deep Learning".

The code is written in Python 3.6 to run in Pytorch 0.4.
